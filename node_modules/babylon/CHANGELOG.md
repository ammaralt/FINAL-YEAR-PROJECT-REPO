### :rocket: New Feature

***ESTree*** compatibility as plugin ([#277](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/277)) (Daniel Tschinder)

We finally introduce a new compatibility layer for ESTree. To put babylon into ESTree-compatible mode the new plugin `estree` can be enabled. In this mode the parser will output an AST that is compliant to the specs of [ESTree](https://github.com/estree/estree/)

We highly recommend everyone who uses babylon outside of babel to use this plugin. This will make it much easier for users to switch between different ESTree-compatible parsers. We so far tested several projects with different parsers and exchanged their parser to babylon and in nearly all cases it worked out of the box. Some other estree-compatible parsers include `acorn`, `esprima`, `espree`, `flow-parser`, etc.

To enable `estree` mode simply add the plugin in the config:
```json
{
  "plugins": [ "estree" ]
}
```

If you want to migrate your project from non-ESTree mode to ESTree, have a look at our [Readme](https://github.com/babel/babylon/#output), where all deviations are mentioned.

Add a parseExpression public method ([#213](https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/213)) (jeromew)

Babylon exports a new function to parse a single expression

```js
import { parseExpression } from 'babylon';

const ast = parseExpression('x || y &&
